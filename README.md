# Instant Desktop
This application will replace [Infinity Desktop](https://github.com/DaraJKong/Infinity-Desktop), which was made using AutoHotkey and used some "magic" workarounds to get the monitor IDs.

This application is in development. Instant Desktop currently only lists the active monitors like the "mstsc /l" command. This feature will be the foundation for the tool. A user interface will be designed to let the user choose quickly the monitors to use during the remote desktop connection.
